# 💧 Water Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is part of the **AICTE Virtual Internship Program**.  
It aims to classify water as **safe** or **unsafe** based on chemical parameter limits using a machine learning model.

- **BSK5 (BOD - Biochemical Oxygen Demand)**
- **Suspended Solids**
- **O₂ (Dissolved Oxygen)**
- **NO₃ (Nitrate)**
- **NO₂ (Nitrite)**
- **SO₄ (Sulfate)**
- **PO₄ (Phosphate)**
- **Cl (Chloride)**

## 🧪 What Was Done (Week 1)
- Loaded the dataset using `pandas`
- Checked dataset structure, missing values, and stats
- Dropped rows with missing values
- Removed `id` and `date` columns
- Cleaned data is ready for further analysis and ML model training

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcome
- Understood the role of environmental chemical parameters
- Learned data cleaning with pandas
- Prepared real-world data for AI model use
